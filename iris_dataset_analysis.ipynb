    "The raw data can be seen in **Inputs** folder in [iris.data](https://github.com/skerr17/pands_project/blob/main/inputs/iris.data) which was sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). \n",

    "Following doing some research on the Iris Dataset I conducted some initial exploration of the data in the [iris.data](https://github.com/skerr17/pands_project/blob/main/inputs/iris.data). \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_descriptive_statistics()` found in [analysis_code.py](https://github.com/skerr17/pands_project/blob/main/analysis_code.py), generates the descriptive statistics for the global Iris Dataset and by species (`global_descriptive_stats` and `stats_by_species`).  \n",

    "Whereas, `stats_by_species` calculates the Count, Mean, Standard Deviation, Minimum, $25th$ Percentile, Median, $75th$ Percentile, and Maximum for each **Species** of Iris. Using the `groupby('Species')` to subset the dataset based upon each Samples species (**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**) each having a sample size of $n=50$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, saving all the Descriptive Statistics in a Tabular format in a `Text` file titled **[iris_descriptive_stats.txt](outputs/iris_descriptive_stats.txt)** in the **Outputs Folder**.\n",

    "### Insights / Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key insights from the **Global Descriptive Statistics** are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The **Petal Length & Width** are more variable than the **Sepal Length & Width**, suggesting they might have more predictive power for classification (will return to this point to validate).\n",
    "- **Sepal Width** is the most consistent feature across all the species with a standard deviation of $0.43 cm$.\n",
    "- **Petal Length** has the highest variability with a standard deviation of $1.77 cm$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the **global statistics** show that Sepal dimensions tend to be larger than Petal dimensions. Specifically, **Sepal Length** has a mean of $5.84 cm$ and **Sepal Width** a mean of $3.05 cm$, compared to **Petal Length** with a mean of $3.76 cm$ and **Petal Width** with $1.20 cm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key insights from the **Descriptive Statistics per Species** are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setosa** is the smallest in overall measurements and has low variability. Making it the easiest to classify from the others.\n",
    "- **Versicolor** is the intermediate in terms of feature values with more variability than **Setosa** and commonly overlapping with **Virginica** which means it is harder to classify.\n",
    "- **Virginica** is the largest Sepal and Petal dimensions with the highest within species variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested in the **Global Descriptive Statistics** the **Petal Length & Width** is the most effective feature for distinguishing species, while **Sepal Width** being the hardest to classify the species."
