# Programming & Scripting Project

By Stephen Kerr

## Purpose of this Repository 
In this Repository I will submit my main project assessment for the Module Programming & Scripting taught by Andrew Beatty (email: andrew.beatty@atu.ie) for my HDIP in Computing and Data Analytics.

The following Problem Statment was assinged: 
>'This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set
and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An online search for
information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it
previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.'
